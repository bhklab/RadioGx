Description: Computational tool box for radio-genomic analysis which integrates
    radio-response data, radio-biological modelling and comprehensive cell line
    annotations for hundreds of cancer cell lines. The 'RadioSet' class enables
    creation and manipulation of standardized datasets including information
    about cancer cells lines, radio-response assays and dose-response indicators. 
    Included methods allow fitting and plotting dose-response data using 
    established radio-biological models along with quality control to validate
    results. Additional functions related to fitting and plotting dose response 
    curves, quantifying statistical correlation and calculating area under the
    curve (AUC) or survival fraction (SF) are included. For more details please 
    see the included documentation, references, as well as:
